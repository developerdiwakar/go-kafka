# GoKafka - Building a Real-time Data Pipeline with Go and Kafka

**Disclaimer**: This example provides a basic outline of a real-time data pipeline using Go and Kafka. Real-world implementations would require additional considerations like error handling, performance optimization, and security.

**Prerequisites**
A running Kafka cluster
Go environment set up
Necessary libraries installed: github.com/Shopify/sarama for Kafka integration

**Code Structure**
We'll break down the pipeline into three main components:

- Data Source: Simulating data generation.
- Kafka Producer: Sending data to Kafka.
- Kafka Consumer: Consuming data and processing it.
