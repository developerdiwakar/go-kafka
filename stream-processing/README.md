# Complete code example on Stream processing: Performing computations on incoming data streams using Go lang and Kafka.

## Stream Processing with Go and Kafka
### Understanding the Challenge

While Go doesn't have a built-in stream processing library like Kafka Streams, we can effectively handle stream processing by combining Kafka's message streaming capabilities with Go's concurrency primitives. This involves consuming data from Kafka, processing it in parallel, and potentially producing new data streams.

### Code Structure

We'll structure the code into three main components:

- **Kafka Consumer:** 
    Consuming data from a Kafka topic.

- **Data Processor:** Processing the incoming data.

- **Kafka Producer (Optional):** Producing new data streams based on processing results.

### Code Implementation
Go to `main.go` file

### Explanation

1. **Consume Data:**
Creates a channel to receive incoming data.
Spawns a goroutine to consume data from Kafka, unmarshal it, and send it to the channel.

2. **Process Data:**
Receives data from the channel.
Performs desired computations on the data.
Optionally, produces new data to another topic (not implemented in this example).

3. **Main Function:**
Starts the consumer and processor.

### Key Points

- **Concurrency:** Use goroutines and channels to handle concurrent processing.

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for Kafka operations and data processing.

- **Data Format:** Choose an appropriate data format for serialization/deserialization (e.g., JSON, Avro).

- **Windowing:** For time-based processing, use libraries like time/window or custom implementations.

- **State Management:** If required, use in-memory state or external storage (e.g., Redis, databases) for stateful computations.

- **Scalability:** Consider using distributed systems frameworks or libraries for large-scale stream processing.

### Additional Considerations

- **Libraries:** Explore libraries like go-kafka or sarama for advanced features and performance optimizations.
- **Frameworks:** For complex stream processing pipelines, consider using frameworks like Apache Flink or Apache Spark.
- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to ensure code correctness and reliability.

This code provides a basic foundation for stream processing using Go and Kafka. You can extend it with more complex computations, state management, and output handling based on your specific requirements.

1. **Consume Data:**
    - Creates a channel to receive incoming data.
    - Spawns a goroutine to consume data from Kafka, unmarshal it, and send it to the  channel.
2. **Process Data:**
    - Receives data from the channel.
    - Performs desired computations on the data.
    - Optionally, produces new data to another topic (not implemented in this example).
3. **Main Function:**
